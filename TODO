* Implement more methods in Resources.php to complete API.
* Refactor tests:
  - create a test class for each .php file instead of one huge one for
    everything
  - maybe too much code duplication in the test, but is it better that way to
    keep the tests loosely coupled?
* Even lazier loading of lists: avoid loading an instance just to figure out if
  a subresource exists.
* PEAR coding standards compliance
